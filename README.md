# HackDuke
This repository contains my submission for HackDuke 2019. Our team consists of: Ara Chung, Duc Le, Matthew Thayer, and I, Storm King.
The only file missing from this repository is the word2vec pre-trained Google News corpus (3 billion running words) word vector model (3 million 300-dimension English word vectors) due to the size of the file(3.6GB).
That file can be obtained at Google's official website or here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit
